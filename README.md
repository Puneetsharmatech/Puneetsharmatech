### Hi there, I'm Puneet Sharma ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent cloud computing graduate from Loyalist College with a passion for building, securing, and automating robust cloud infrastructure. My focus is on **DevOps** principles and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, and I'm a Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator (AZ-104) with a knack for turning complex problems into scalable, elegant solutions.

I'm currently seeking a full-time **Cloud Engineer**, **DevOps Engineer**, or **Cloud Administrator** role in Canada where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow.

### My Journey with Code

I believe that the best solutions are not just functionalâ€”they're automated, secure, and built for scale. This passion drives me to constantly explore and build. My toolbox is built around this philosophy, with a focus on **Azure**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **Python**.
